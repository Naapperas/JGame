# JGame
 A simple Game Engine written entirely in Java made for the simplest of games

 I was trying to make a Java version of the famous game Pong. However, my code quickly got pretty messed up and inefficient, so i scrapped that and started over. With the idea of just picking simple elements, smashing them together and getting a game, JGame was born.

# Introduction

The entry point for any game is <code>GameLauncher</code>. However, you first need to define a <code>Window</code> and every <code>Entity</code>/<code>UIHudElement</code>/<code>GameState</code> that exists in the lifetime of your game. Only then should the <code>launch</code> method be called.
