# JGame
 A simple Game Engine written entirely in Java made for the simplest of games

 I was trying to make a Java version of the famous game Pong. However, my code quickly got pretty messed up and inefficient, so i scrapped that and started over. With the idea of just picking simple elements, smashing them together and getting a game, JGame was born.

 If anyone has any suggestions or possible improvements fell free to let know :)
